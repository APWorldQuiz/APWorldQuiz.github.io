          <h1 class = "text-center">You're most likely the Roman Empire.</h1>
          <p class = "text-center">In its heyday from 100 BC to 400 AD, the Roman Empire stretched across the Mediterranean Basin, into North Africa, the Middle East, and much of Europe. </p>
          
          <h2>Interaction Between Humans and the Environment</h2>
          <p>The Roman Empire utilized natural resources on a massive, unprecedented scale. With the expansion of Rome came the deforestation of large tracts of land in order to provide fuel and timber. A need for natural resources drove the Roman Empire’s conquests into Africa and Europe, rapidly increasing the amount of mineral resources and lumber extracted from both continents.</p>
          <h2>Development and Interaction of Cultures</h2>
          <p>Roman culture built upon Hellenistic, or Greek culture. This Hellenistic influence manifested itself in Roman art, theater, and religion. The Roman Republic worshipped a series of immortal deities under a polytheistic system. Religion was incorporated into every aspect of the Roman Empire, including its legal system and military. In the latter half of Rome’s history, Christianity became the predominant religion, and would later dominate all of Europe during the post-classical period. Extravagant religious monuments were built, and Christian culture was spread to the entirety of the Mediterranean basin.


          </p>
          <h2>State-Building, Expansion, and Conflict</h2>
          <p>Rome was an empire founded on conquest. They relied on more or less continuous military conquest to bring new slaves and economic regions into the fold. As a result, the Roman Empire  incorporated diverse cultures, environments, and political systems of the regions they conquered into the larger Roman empire.

          </p>
          <h2>Creation, Expansion, and Interaction of Economic Systems</h2>
          <p>The Roman Empire was the dominant economic power of the Mediterranean region, partially through the spoils they earned across their many successful military conquests. Roman merchants also sought profits in foreign locals, like China. Trade with Han China along the silk road proved to be a lucrative venture for all parties involved. Elites of the Roman Empire became a major market of the Chinese silk industry, utilizing trade networks in Eurasia to move luxury goods across vast distances.</p>
          <h2>Development and Transformation of Social Structures</h2>
          <p>Rome was a highly stratified society, with a large population of slaves, a plebeian class, and and an aristocracy made up of the land-owning patricians. Patricians had rural land-holdings, but resided primarily in the urban centers of the empire. Throughout the history of the empire, Rome became increasingly dependent on the labor of an unsustainably sized slave population, which came primarily from the conquest of territory in Europe and Africa. The ruling aristocratic families were patriarchal in nature, and had influence over dealings of the Senate.
