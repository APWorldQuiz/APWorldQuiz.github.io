          <h1 class = "text-center">You're most likely Han China.</h1>
          <p class = "text-center">Spanning over four centuries, the Han Dynasty marked a golden age in China’s history. Developments occurring in China under the Han would set the stage for the rest of the nation’s, and the wider world’s history. The Han Dynasty is responsible for the foundation of modern Chinese script - known as the “Han characters,” and is the origin of modern China’s largest ethnic group - the Han people.</p>
          
          <h2>Interaction Between Humans and the Environment</h2>
          <p>This iron age civilization developed metallurgy independent of other metalworking civilizations from this time. They extracted iron ore from the earth to produce tools, weapons, and agricultural equipment. The Han utilized timber, stone, and rammed earth to construct monuments such as the Great Wall. Rammed earth had a relatively low environmental impact, as it was simply the use of compressed soil and stone as a structural material, which could easily be returned to the environment with decay. The Han’s use of lumber, however, had a widespread and often devastating effect on forest ecosystems.</p>
          <h2>Development and Interaction of Cultures</h2>
          <p>Confucianism valued respect to superiors and also merit. The idea that divine intervention put emperors out of power when they were morally flawed. Confucianism stressed responsibility to elders, especially the father-son relationship.
          </p>
          <h2>State-Building, Expansion, and Conflict</h2>
          <p>The Qin dynasty created the world's first extensive bureaucracy, which was inherited by the Han. China became highly centralized, and the great wall began construction to ward off nomadic invaders from the North.
          </p>
          <h2>Creation, Expansion, and Interaction of Economic Systems</h2>
          <p>Han China did lots of trading with Rome along the Silk Road trade route. The name is the route itself comes from the highly valuable silk the Chinese produced, which for many thousands of years they had a sole monopoly on. The Chinese also did some trading with South Asia and India, as Han China and these areas were in in close geographic proximity.</p>
          <h2>Development and Transformation of Social Structures</h2>
          <p>Like all classical empires, Han China had patriarchy deeply set in place. The most important relationship in confucianism is that between a father and son. The empire also had a different social stratification than most other empires. Although the Emperor and government officials had the most elite position, there was no elite religious group. Also, merchants and artisans were considered below farmers.
