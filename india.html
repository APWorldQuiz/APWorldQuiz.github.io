          <h1 class = "text-center">You are definitely either the Maurya or Gupta Empire.</h1>
          <p class = "text-center">The Maurya dynasty ruled nearly all of the Indian subcontinent from 300 to 180 BC. At its time, it was one of the largest unified empires on the planet, and would rival the size and influence of the Roman Empire that came hundreds of years later. The Gupta Empire was significantly smaller in geographic territory, but is of equal importance to the Classical Period. From 300 to 500 AD, the Indian subcontinent flourished in a golden age of science, technology, engineering, art, and literature under the Gupta Empire. The spread and growth of Hinduism as a world religion coincides with this golden age.</p>
          
          <h2>Interaction Between Humans and the Environment</h2>
          <p>The Indian subcontinent is a geographically diverse place. However, its position in the Indian Ocean allowed the empires there to trade with neighboring regions.</p>

          <h2>Development and Interaction of Cultures</h2>
          <p>The Indian subcontinent experienced a myriad of religions throughout its history. At the inception of the Mauryan Empire, Hinduism was already well established as a religion. Under the Mauryan and Gupta Empires, the religions of Jainism and Buddhism developed. Chandragupta Maurya's embrace of Jainism increased social and religious renewal and reform across his society, while Ashoka's embrace of Buddhism has been said to have been the foundation of the reign of social and political peace and nonviolence across all of India.
          </p>

          <h2>State-Building, Expansion, and Conflict</h2>
          <p>The Empire was founded in 322 BC by Chandragupta Maurya.  By 316 BCE the empire had fully occupied Northwestern India. The conquests of Alexander the Great of Macedonia in 327 BC left no significant cultural effects on the continent, nor did it establish a continuing Greek political presence in the continent. It did, however, create a power vacuum that led to Chandragupta’s consolidation of power into the Mauryan Empire. Under the Maurya, the Empire developed a vast and effective bureaucracy, and a codified legal system. Ashoka, the grandson of Chandragupta, created and enforced a system of law known as the Edicts of Ashoka. These edicts created a unified legal system across the entire empire, paralleling the Code of Hammurabi in Babylon. Soon after Ashoka’s death, the Mauryan dynasty fell, and India entered a period of fragmentation in which regional kingdoms ruled the subcontinent. Towards the end of the Classical Period, the Gupta empire formed and once again consolidated power in India. While it never grew to the prominence or size of the Mauryan Empire, the Gupta Empire did create a more lasting period of political unity. While the Mauryan Empire established a powerful centralized bureaucracy across the entire subcontinent, the Gupta Empire allowed for more regional power to develop.  
          </p>

          <h2>Creation, Expansion, and Interaction of Economic Systems</h2>
          <p>
            Before the Mauryan Empire, dozens of disparate regional kingdoms governed India. Political boundaries and constant regional warfare created trade boundaries that inhibited the flow of goods and services across India. With the unification of these political units under the Mauryan Empire, interregional trade flourished within India as well as with the wider world. Farmers were transitioned from paying exorbitant taxes to local kings to paying fair taxes to a central bureaucratic authority. A central currency established by Chandragupta improved trade, and a Mauryan military force eliminated banditry along trade routes.  </p>
          
          <h2>Development and Transformation of Social Structures</h2>
          <p>The Mauryan and Gupta Empires enforced a strict social hierarchy, also known as the caste system. Under this system, Indian society was split into four social strata known as varnas: the Brahmins (priests, scholars, and teachers), Kshatriyas (rulers, warriors, and administrators), Vaishyas (cattle herders, agriculturalists, artisans, and merchants) and the Shudras (laborers). The Mauryan and Gupta Empires used a religious justification from Hinduism to create large social inequality.
